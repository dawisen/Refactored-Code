# Homework-1

This code was refactored to create a website that meets accessibility criteria and implements semantic html.

I changed several div tags into header, figure, main, section, aside, and footer to divide the webpage into its corresponding sections.
I added alt text or title text to images on the webpage for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.
I reformatted the html so that it looks "cleaner" to improve readability.
