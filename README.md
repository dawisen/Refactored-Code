# Refactored Code
This code was refactored to create a website that meets accessibility criteria and implements semantic html:

Changed several div tags into `<header>, <figure>, <main>, <section>, <aside>` and `<footer>` to divide the webpage into its corresponding sections.
Added alt text and title text to images on the webpage for improved accessibility and search engine optimization.
Reformatted the html so that it looks "cleaner" to improve readability.
